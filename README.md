# Retail Order Insights of a Supermarket

### Overview

This project involves using the Kaggle API to download datasets (or you can directly download the data from this repository) , performing data cleaning and processing using Python, and analyzing the data using SQL. The analysis includes extracting insights, performing aggregations, and generating visualizations.

### 1.Kaggle API

Use the Kaggle API to authenticate and programmatically download the dataset to your local machine.
Or download the required dataset from this repository.

### 2.Python

Load the datasets into Python, preferably in a Jupyter Notebook.
Load the downloaded dataset into a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

### 3.Data Cleaning and Processing

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct data types, and perform necessary transformations.

Steps:

1.Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.Identify and handle missing values.
3.Remove duplicate records.
4.Correct data types as required.
5.Apply necessary transformations to the data.

### 4.Load Data

Establish a connection to SQL Server using Python, create appropriate tables, and insert the cleaned data into the database.
Tools: SQL, Python (with libraries such as pyodbc or sqlalchemy)

Steps:

1.Set up a connection to SQL Server using Python.
2.Create the necessary tables in SQL Server.
3.Insert the cleaned data into these tables.


### 5.Data Analysis using SQL

Write and execute SQL queries to extract insights, perform aggregations and joins, and generate reports and visualizations based on the analysis.
Tools: SQL, Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn in Python)

Steps:

1.Write SQL queries to analyze the data.
2.Perform data aggregation and join operations as needed.
3.Generate insights and create visualizations based on the analysis.
